# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Claire and I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Business at New York University. I'm passionate about activism, volunteering, and current affairs. Catch me in a Manhattan coffee shop with a book or a newspaper. 

I'm completely new to programming, but determined to change that. My goals for this program are to gain basic knowledge and skills for web development. I hope to pursue a career in entrepreneurship and sustainable business design, and want to build a foundation in computer science in order to keep up with a world where technology and business are becoming inevitably intertwined.
